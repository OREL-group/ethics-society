# OREL Ethics & Society Team
*A new Orthogonal Research & Education Lab - Ethics &amp; Society, focusing on AI Ethics, society-tech issues, law, programming ethics, and dovetails into fairness &amp; interpretability / explainability*

### Current Project: NYCWiC '21 AI Ethics Presentation, and AI Now's AI Lexicon submissions

In the action-item sense, the NYCWiC accepted presentation is in the works, but the Ethics Team at my lab itself has a variety of projects on this topic. 1) NYCWiC presentation, 2) Submissions to AI Now's AI Lexicon short essays call for involvement, 3) Manuscript - eventual development into much broader, refined paper. We are not AI Ethics Experts, but we can engage in cross-disciplinary team work in way befitting of operating within AI Ethics endeavors. 

#### AI Ethics Presentation: Call for Involvement

- Involvement/Time commitment minimum: in the next month (Due ~ April 5), read materials and contribute to at least one slide / 60 seconds of presentation (there are several opportunities for greater involvement)

Questions for YOU
- **What area of focus are you interested in?** (There are some broad categories below, but the specifics of our presentation will depend on contributors. 
- **Involvement level?** This project is intentionally collaborative and open. However, if you are interested in fleshing out these topics more, beyond the narrow scope of the presentation at NYCWiC, there are opportunities to contribute to / develop topical essays to another venue's submissions, as well as a broader manuscript to go much more in-depth at a holistic level. However, the presentation at NYCWiC is nice, because it affords people from different backgrounds  an opportunity to work together, even without being 'ai ethics experts', and get experience at cross-discipline collaboration befitting much of the work necessary in AI Ethics itself.
