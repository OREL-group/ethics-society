## Abstract Submission
#### Towards a Sufficient Unified Ethical Frameworks for AI: Challenges & Opportunities
As artificial intelligence and automation of critical decision making becomes more ubiquitous, society’s need for systematic attempts to guide responsible engagement and implementation of these tools deepens. But in a world of preexisting and diverse approaches to ethics and culture already, how can we strive towards a coherent framework to guide the rapid advances in AI? This is no trivial task, but to make headway on this path, we will discuss key concepts influencing the development of ethical AI frameworks, including: the relationship between technology implementation and lagging law updates; the trouble of “neutrality”; historical influences and impacts on norms; automated decision-making; and examination of what broad values can guide a framework for the 21st century. Our aim will be to lay out an overview of the challenges of developing a coherent ethical framework, note challenges for buy-in and implementation, and make suggestions of fruitful areas of further research.
